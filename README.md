# kobra-2-neo-klipper-optimized-files
This repository contains Klipper configuration files for the Anycubic Kobra 2 Neo, featuring tested and optimized values for high-speed, reliable printing.
Originally based on configurations by XenyonMedia and MysteriousCable (Reddit), this version includes several updates and fixes by Alex Paul, such as:

Removal of outdated variables

Tuning for common filaments (PLA, PETG, etc.)

Stable high-speed infill printing up to 220 mm/s

Max acceleration: 5000 mm/s²

Travel: 10,000 mm/s² at 250 mm/s

Modified start macro optimized for automation workflows

Traditional purge line has been replaced with a purge "pop" — a short extrusion blob that gets flattened and wiped by the nozzle moving across the build plate.

This may occasionally leave a small blob (“poop”) behind, which you’ll need to remove manually before the once a week.

You’re free to tweak this behavior based on your own preference.

Important: Ensure your Z-offset is dialed in accurately — if it's too low, the first move might ram into the bed and mess up your printer.

Ideal for users looking to push the performance of their Kobra 2 Neo with Klipper.
